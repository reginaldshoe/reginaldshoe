- 👋 Hi, I’m @reginaldshoe
- 👀 I’m interested in Operations Research, Numerical methods, portfolio optimisation, and the maths-y side of programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build predictive models and using enterprise GCP lakehouse to run SQL tables and views.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun python-y or matlab-ish algorithms. I have expertise in the natural resources sectors, so anything in that zone would be fun I reckon
